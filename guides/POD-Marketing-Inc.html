  <h2>✅ Implementation Tips</h2>
  <div class="tips-grid">
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>🧠 Use Swag to Reinforce Culture</strong><br>
      Launch quarterly drops that align with company values (e.g., “Accountability” socks, “Ownership” mugs). Attach a Slack post or internal campaign to each drop to build momentum.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>🎁 Segment Clients by Loyalty</strong><br>
      Send new clients starter kits with 1–2 branded items. Reserve signature “moment” boxes for milestone achievements, renewals, or VIPs. It creates a clear incentive journey.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>📸 Design for Shareability</strong><br>
      Go beyond logos—design swag that begs to be posted. Think humor, inspiration, and color blocking. Even a basic mug becomes viral with the right phrase and layout.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>🚀 Track Swag ROI at Events</strong><br>
      Use QR codes on all event giveaways. Link them to a landing page with a UTM tag to see how much traffic or form fill came from swag.
