    <h2>Implementation Tips</h2>
    <div class="tips-grid">
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>üí° Elevate With Intent</strong><br>
        Choose materials and styles that reflect your food. Avoid disposable promo. The more permanent the item feels, the more likely it will be cherished.
      </div>
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>üï∞ Gift at Peak Moments</strong><br>
        Swag should feel like part of the memory. Gifting when a guest checks out, during birthdays, or at the end of a chef's table elevates the story.
      </div>
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>üåç Go Local When Possible</strong><br>
        Partner with NYC & Miami creatives. From ceramics to scent designers, co-branded goods deepen authenticity and make swag feel rare.
      </div>
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>üì∏ Use It As Content</strong><br>
        Create stories around your swag drops. Unboxings, behind-the-scenes production, or moments of gifting are all high-performing social content.
      </div>
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>üîÅ Keep a Rotation System</strong><br>
        Build a 4-season release calendar. One core item per quarter (a tote, then pin, then scent, then box) keeps your community engaged.
      </div>
      <div class="tip">
        <strong>üëÇ Let Your Team Co-Create</strong><br>
        Ask FOH/BOH what they‚Äôd wear or use. You‚Äôll uncover unexpected ideas‚Äîmaybe a shift journal, a lighter, or rest-day gear‚Äîthat spark real team pride.
