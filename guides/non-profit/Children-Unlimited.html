  <h2>Implementation Tips</h2>
  <div class="tips-grid">
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üéØ Plan for the 40th Early</strong><br>
      Secure inventory by spring 2026 for anniversary items. Custom products like coins or boxes may have longer lead times, especially for nonprofit pricing.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üéÅ Bundle by Donor Tier</strong><br>
      Use branded blankets, tumblers, or keepsake boxes to represent thank-you levels in fundraising campaigns. This adds value and encourages higher giving.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üí¨ Add Story Tags</strong><br>
      Use printed inserts, QR codes, or belly bands to share your 40-year story and the impact of donor support with each swag item.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üì∏ Make It Participatory</strong><br>
      Let families, staff, and donors contribute to the community quilt or submit stories online, then turn these into interactive displays or limited-edition items.
