  <h2>Implementation Tips</h2>
  <div class="tips-grid">
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üõ†Ô∏è Meet Them Where They Work</strong><br>
      Operators love gear they can actually use. Focus on swag that integrates into a shift manager‚Äôs day‚Äîcoffee mugs, notepads, or tech pouches will land better than decorative items.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üîó Link Physical with Digital</strong><br>
      Bridge swag to platform features. Use QR codes on hard goods that route to dashboard demos, live support, or case studies. Turn mugs and desk items into interactive sales tools.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üéØ Maximize Key Moments</strong><br>
      Deploy premium swag around event peaks and launches. Ship kits to key customers before a feature drop or industry show. Think: ‚Äúgolden hour box‚Äù for evening demos.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üß¢ Internal Culture Is Brand Culture</strong><br>
      Use apparel internally to fuel team identity. Branded polos, softshells, or field shirts foster pride and create cohesion across hybrid and remote teams.
    </div>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>üì¶ Bundle Smart, Send Strategically</strong><br>
      Don‚Äôt just hand out one item. Build lightweight kits around themes (e.g., ‚Äúrescue,‚Äù ‚Äúinsight,‚Äù ‚Äúdaily tools‚Äù) and personalize packaging for key personas: techs, GMs, ops execs.
