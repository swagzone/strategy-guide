      <!-- Intro -->
      <section>
        <p>
          Before looking at any individual idea in StockBuddy or TraderPal, we like to start with one simple question:
          <span class="font-semibold">“What kind of market are we in today?”</span>
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          The <span class="font-semibold">Regime Score</span> is our way of answering that in plain English. It doesn’t tell you
          what to buy or sell. It just labels the overall environment so you know whether conditions look friendly,
          mixed, or rough.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- What is the Regime Score -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">What is the Regime Score?</h2>
        <p>
          The Regime Score is a daily “market weather” reading. Internally, we look at a bunch of signals
          (volatility, breadth, trend, news tone, etc.) and compress them into a single classification.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          On your side, you don’t see the calculations — you just see a simple label like:
          <span class="font-semibold">Hot</span>, <span class="font-semibold">Warm</span>,
          <span class="font-semibold">Icy</span>, or <span class="font-semibold">Cold</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-white/70 text-sm italic">
          It’s context, not a signal. You decide if and how you want to act on it.
        </p>

      <!-- The four regimes -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">The Four Regimes (In Plain English)</h2>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-3 text-mwTeal">1. Hot</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">
          “Hot” means the market looks clean and supportive for momentum. Trends are behaving, breakouts are
          more likely to stick, and the tape feels risk-on.
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-white/80 text-sm space-y-1">
          <li>Moves tend to follow through more often.</li>
          <li>Pullbacks feel like dips, not disasters.</li>
          <li>We generally prefer our bullish swing ideas in this environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-5 text-mwTeal">2. Warm</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">
          “Warm” is our normal, everyday regime. The market is workable, but not perfect. Some things trend nicely,
          others chop around.
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-white/80 text-sm space-y-1">
          <li>Still fine for ideas, just less ideal than Hot.</li>
          <li>We expect mixed behaviour: some clean, some messy.</li>
          <li>Pullbacks and headlines matter a bit more.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-5 text-mwTeal">3. Icy</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">
          “Icy” means conditions are getting defensive or choppy. Things still move, but the tape is less forgiving.
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-white/80 text-sm space-y-1">
          <li>Breakouts fail more often, reversals show up faster.</li>
          <li>Index moves can feel whippy and frustrating.</li>
          <li>We treat this as a “heads-up” to be more cautious and pay attention to downside risk.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-5 text-mwTeal">4. Cold</h3>
        <p class="mt-1">
          “Cold” is our risk-off regime. Volatility, credit, or macro tone suggest the market is under stress or reacting
          to shocks.
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc list-inside text-white/80 text-sm space-y-1">
          <li>Moves can be sharp, emotional, and news-driven.</li>
          <li>Gaps and intraday reversals are more common.</li>
          <li>We see this as a time to think more about defense, not offense.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- What the score tells you / doesn’t tell you -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">What the Regime Score Tells You (and What It Doesn’t)</h2>
        <p>
          The Regime Score is designed to be <span class="font-semibold">simple and limited on purpose</span>.
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-3 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>It <span class="font-semibold">does</span> tell you: how friendly or hostile the overall environment looks.</li>
          <li>It <span class="font-semibold">does</span> tell you: whether today feels more like “go with trends” or “be more defensive”.</li>
          <li>It <span class="font-semibold">does not</span> tell you: what to buy, what to sell, or how much to risk.</li>
          <li>It <span class="font-semibold">does not</span> tell you: anything about your personal situation or portfolio.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-3 text-white/70 text-sm italic">
          It’s one layer of context you can combine with your own judgment, rules, and risk limits.
        </p>

      <!-- How it connects to your products (soft) -->
      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">How It Fits With StockBuddy & TraderPal</h2>
        <p>
          In <span class="font-semibold">StockBuddy</span>, you mainly see the end result: clear ideas with entries,
          stops, and targets. In <span class="font-semibold">TraderPal</span>, the Regime Score sits above the ideas
          and gives you a quick snapshot of the market mood first.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          Many users simply check the Regime label (Hot, Warm, Icy, or Cold) and the Trade / Caution / No-Trade note
          <span class="italic">before</span> they look at any setups. It’s an easy way to avoid treating every single
          day like it’s the same.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Closing -->
      <section>
        <p>
          You don’t need to know how the Regime Score is calculated to use it. Just think of it as a quick
          “market weather” headline to read before you dive into the details.
